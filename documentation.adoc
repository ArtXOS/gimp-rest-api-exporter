= gimp-rest-api-exporter

Export to RESTfull API plugin for GIMP. You can use this plugin to make faster the process of sending images to your server, after they've been edited. You can export current layer or the whole project as final raster image. This plugin provides export in two formats: pgn and jpg. Plugin creates tmp png/jpg file, then sends it to the server. After receiving a response, prints a response body to UI and changes the status label. Also plugin can be used with authorized requests. By default it uses Bearer token (you have to fill token entry without Bearer prefix)

IMPORTANT: Under development. Tested on WIN10, GIMP 2.10.22. export.py was added to %AppData%\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins folder

IMPORTANT: Find the APIexport in upper menu bar. It will be active, if you have at least one layer in your project

.Instalation:
. Required version of GIMP is 2.10.22
. Put the exporter.py to the GIMP's plugins folder (if it doesnt work, put the script to %AppData%\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins folder)
. Check the execution rights of exporter.py 

=== Short user manual:

.Simple usage wihout authorization:
. Find APIexport in the upper menu bar
. Enter the hostname
. Click the connect button
. Enter the endpoint
. Choose what will be exported and preferable format
. Enter the name
. Click export and wait for the response

TIP: Some UI and Request settings are at the beginning. Feel free to change them

TIP: In **export_on_click** function you can change the way how the payload will be filled. F.e. you don't want your file to be sent with a key "texture", so you can change it

TIP: Plugin uses **POST** request for an export by default. You can change it by setting **EXPORT_HTTP_METHOD** variable. Also you can change the behavior of your Export by editing **export_on_click** callback function (for example by adding additional headers to your request or by changing the structure of the payload with the file for exporting)

TIP: You can also change the authorization simply by calling **set_authorization** method of User object in **connect_on_click** callback function. Method expects to take a dictionary as argument f.e. "{"Authorization": ... }". This dictionary will be added as an additional header to your request

image::./doc/plugin_ui.png[300 ,400, align="center"]

.UI elements:
* Username: your username, which can be added to request body or headers. `Not used by default`.
* Email: your email, which can be added to request body or headers. `Not used by default`.
* Token: your token. `Be default is Bearer token`.  Just enter your token without "Bearer" prefix.
* Host: hostname of the server, where the request will be sent. `Should start with "http://" or "https://"`.
* Connect button: when clicked, plugin will check, if there are any responses from the server. If there were a response, Status will change to `Connected successfully`, to `Connection error` if not.
* Status: placeholder for short response status. HTTP response code and small message.
* Endpoint: request endpoint. (Check your API docs).
* Response scrolled window: place, where response body will be shown.
* Radio buttons: you can export current layer, or the whole bitmap of your project. `When exporting whole bitmap, the result of 'merge visible layers' will be exported`.
* Format radio buttons: choose the preferable file format. PNG or JPG will be created with default values.
* File name: choose the name for the image, which be exported.
* Export button: will send a request to an endpoint with the image in request body and optional headers added `You have to connect first`.

=== Example of exporting process: TODO

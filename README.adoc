=== Short user manual:

.Simple usage wihout authorization:
. Enter the hostname
. Click the connect button
. Enter the endpoint
. Choose what will be exported and preferable format
. Enter the name
. Click export and wait for the response

TIP: Some UI and Request settings are at the beggining. Feel free to change them

TIP: Plugin uses **POST** request for an export by default. You can change it by setting **EXPORT_HTTP_METHOD** variable. Also you can change the behavior of your Export by editing **export_on_click** callback function (for example by adding additional headers to your request or by changing the structure of the payload with the file for exporting)

TIP: You can also change the authorization simply by calling **set_authorization** method of User object in **connect_on_click** callback function. Method expects to take a dictionary as argument f.e. "{"Authorization": ... }". This dictionary will be added as an additional header to your request
